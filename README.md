# -Boundaries-of-Urban-Historic-Areas-based-on-GNNs
#We are maintaining this project, and the current version does not represent the final version.
#
#The establishment of this project is mainly to try to find the historical area of the city quickly by using neural network. The author hopes that this method is simpler and more effective than the previous manual method.
The specific article is expected to be published in 2024 CAD confrence. (Not yet finalized)

[主]通用标准代码模块.ipynb is the main program of the project.It uses Jupyter Notebook to write Python program files. You can open it on jupyter, and it is recommended to use Google's colab to open it.
Before running all the programs, you need to download the original data that constitutes a graph. Here I provide some original data of Kaifeng, China.“开封点属性.csv” and “开封边属性.scv”。After downloading them, please link the two original files in the correct position in the third code block in the main program.If you are using Google's colab notebook, you should be able to run this program at this time. If you are running locally, you may need to download some other third-party libraries as prompted.
After running successfully in sequence, you can get the location distribution of Kaifeng's historical city in the last small code block under the code block named "获取核心区位置".
If you want to visually observe the calculation results, you need to manually mark these prompt nodes on the map, or you can directly download the results marked by me in the file. The official planning of Kaifeng City is also included in the document.
